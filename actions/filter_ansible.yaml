      Names of the tasks that you would like to extract results from.
      tasks:
        - name: "task 1"

      Data will be extracted in the order requested.
      By default, all vars will be extracted from each task. If you would like to
      limit what vars are extracted, simple add a list a vars to each task object:
      tasks:
        - name: "task 1"
          vars:
            - stdout_lines
        - name: "task 2"
          vars:
            - some_other_var_name
runner_type: "python-script"
